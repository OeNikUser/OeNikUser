Hello!ðŸ‘‹

I'm a programmer currently focused on developing my skills in Arduino and C#. I actively work on projects utilizing these technologies and continually seek ways to improve and grow. âœ¨ I'm also deeply interested in neural networks and artificial intelligence. This passion has led me to start learning Python on my own, and I dedicate time to it whenever possible to expand my knowledge. âœ¨ My long-term goal is to combine embedded systems, high-level programming, and AI technologies to build innovative and intelligent solutions. âœ¨
